# DanSoft
Sistema para gestionar los pagos del alumnado. Ideal para escuelas de danza, idiomas, particulares, entre otros. Empezado en 2014. Última actualización en 2020.

First of all, thank you for taking your time to review what I want to show you.

It is a software I developed using Qt Creator, C++, QML, JavaScript, MySQL Workbench and SQLite.
For example, if you have a dance school, it allows you to manage all your students and their payments.

--> To take a look to the code, you can go to "Programa/manager" and simply open any .cpp with your notepad.

--> To run the project (you need Qt Creator to be installed), open the one with name "ClassManagement.pro" and finally run it.
You can add a new student, so in that way you will be able to experience all the functionalities the software has to offer.

I hope you like it!

Javier Vescio.
